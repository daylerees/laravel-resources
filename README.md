# Laravel Resources

A list of resources for the Laravel framework.

## Websites (tools)

* [Laravel Schema Designer](http://laravelsd.com/) is a schema generator tool. You can graphically create tables and relationships to share. It also can generate laravel migrations automatically from that for quickly getting it into your project.

## Websites (education)

* [Laracasts](https://www.laracasts.com) Perhaps the most recommended education site for not just Laravel, but also modern PHP development. $9 per month for full access to the library (other plans available for yearly/lifetime terms) with a selection of free ones. Well worth checking out.
* [Clean Coders](http://cleancoders.com/) While not directly Laravel related, most if not all of the application architecture applies. Paid per-video.

## Websites (misc)

* [Laravel Snippets](http://laravelsnippets.com/) is a community resource for providing small re-usable code snippets or examples. Comparable to [Bootsnipp](http://bootsnipp.com/).
